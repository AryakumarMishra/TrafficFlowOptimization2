          <h1>Making Traffic Smarter, One Signal at a Time</h1>
          <p>
            We're transforming traffic management with AI! Our innovative system
            uses cutting-edge object detection to count vehicles at
            intersections and automatically adjust traffic signal timings. This
            reduces congestion, improves flow, and helps make roads safer for
            everyone.

              According to a recent McKinsey study, the implementation of
              real-time data into your city's road logistics can help cut
              commuting time by upwards of 15%
            </p>
            <p>
              Our system continuously updates traffic data, providing insights
              into current road conditions, allowing for better traffic flow
              management and quicker responses to congestion. This real-time
              data enables smarter decision-making to avoid bottlenecks before
              they form.

            <h3>Signal Prioritization for Emergency Vehicles</h3>
            <p class="statistic">
              The chance of survival is reduced by 7% to 10% for every minute
              emergency medical assistance is delayed. Likewise, the
              consequences of delayed arrival of police, firefighters, and other
              emergency services can be grave.
            </p>
            <p>
              Traffic signals automatically adjust to give priority to emergency
              vehicles, reducing response times and minimizing disruptions for
              other road users. This helps ensure that emergency services reach
              their destination faster, saving crucial time.

              Over 28% reduction in total vehicle delay of the system is
              achieved with respect to the optimal signal timing that ignores
              the spillback effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              By managing vehicle queues, our system prevents congestion from
              spreading beyond intersections, ensuring smooth traffic flow even
              during peak hours. This proactive control helps avoid gridlock and
              keeps intersections clear for efficient traffic movement.

              Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), such as through adaptive

            <p>
              Optimized traffic flow leads to smoother driving, cutting down
              idle time and reducing harmful emissions, contributing to a
              cleaner environment. With less stop-and-go traffic, fuel
